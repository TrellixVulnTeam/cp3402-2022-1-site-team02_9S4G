## Communication Methods
**What preferred methods of communication has your team decided on?**
(You must have a plan for communicating regularly and effectively.)
Principle communication will be over Slack (DMs) or Discord (DMs, calls, screenshots). Email addresses will be provided but will only be used if primary means of communication fails. Phone numbers will be provided on a case-by-case basis if members feel appropriate and are only to be used in emergencies. Texts will be preferred over calls.

## Meeting Arrangements
**What are your meeting arrangements?**
(When and where are you going to meet outside prac time? weekly, twice a week... in the labs, at a team member's home, on Google Hangouts every 3rd day, etc.)
Meetings will take place over audio call or group DMs using Slack or Discord, primarily in the afternoon and preferably on weekends. Group members will agree on meeting dates times on a weekly basis, usually at the end of an existing meeting.

## Missed Meetings Protocol
**What should a team member do if a planned meeting canâ€™t be attended due to unforeseen circumstances?**
Send apologies in advance to group chat and summarise what you have completed, what you are working on, etc. so it can be included in meeting minutes and discussed at the next meeting if required. Ensure you have read the meeting minutes and resolved any additional queries or comments before the next meeting.

## Dealing with Problems
**What arrangements have you agreed on for what to do if a team member is not working effectively?**
(E.g. if a member does not attend meetings, does not respond to communication attempts or does not complete assigned work.)
If a teammate is refusing to communicate and is unresponsive (after attempts through multiple channels/means), a record of these attempts will be provided to the instructor. If a member is not completing assigned work, records of commits, unfinished Trello tasks, and other proof will be collected and a conversation with the instructor will begin.

## Skills Assessment
**What can each team member contribute to the project?**
(List each team member's name with their currently anticipated role within the team.)

## Challenges
**What challenges do you see for this collaboration?**
Startup and communication early in the project may be a challenge as we are all external and have diverse schedules. Last minute tweaks and issues arising during the weekdays when we work or are time poor may lead to overwork and burnout on the weekends.
Implementing a development workflow that is easy to work with and managing multiple updates from various team members
Creating repeatable test cases for development workflow
